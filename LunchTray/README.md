# Lunch Tray app
App \#5 in Unit 3: Navigation

## Introduction
This app demonstrates all the concepts learned in [Unit 3](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-3)
of Android Basics in Kotlin. These concepts include `ViewModel`, `LiveData`, the navigation
component, data binding, view binding, and fragments.

This app is based off the [starter code](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-basics-kotlin-lunch-tray-app/tree/main)
for the Lunch Tray app. The tests were not modified and used to ensure that the app works as
expected.
