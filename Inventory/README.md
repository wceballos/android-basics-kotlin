# Inventory App
App \#2 in Unit 5: Data Persistence

## Introduction
This app is an inventory tracking app. Inventory is tracked by name, price,
and quantity in stock in a SQLite database. The user can scroll through the
list of items, view item details, sell items, add items, delete items, and
edit items.

This app is based off the [starter code](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-basics-kotlin-inventory-app/tree/starter)
for the Inventory app in Android Basics [Unit 5](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-5).

## Learning Outcomes
- Use `Room` to access a SQL database.
- Create a Data Access Object (`DAO`) to define SQL statements.
- Define a `Room Entity` to map SQL table entries to Kotlin objects.
- Use `Flow` with `LiveData` to observe and respond to databases changes 
  asynchronously.
