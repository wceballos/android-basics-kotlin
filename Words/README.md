# Words App
App \#1 in Unit 3: Navigation

## Introduction
An app that allows you to look up word definitions. The main Activity contains
a list of letters. Clicking a letter launches a new Activity using an explicit
intent where you can see words that start with the selected letter. Then,
clicking on a word launches the browser app using an implicit intent for a
Google search on the definition of the selected word.

This app is based off the [starter code](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-basics-kotlin-words-app/tree/starter)
for the words app in Android Basics [Unit 3](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-3)

## Learning Outcomes
- Use implicit and explicit `Intents`.
- Create an options menu in the `App Bar`.
- Interactively change the layout of a `RecyclerView`.
- Create *instrumentation tests* for app navigation.
