# Sports app
App \#4 in Unit 3: Navigation

## Introduction
This app consists of two screens: a sports list and sport news. It implements a
list-detail pattern, where clicking on the sport opens news about that
particular sport.

The list-detail patter is implemented using a SlidingPaneLayout in order to
adapt to different screen sizes. Small screens alternate between the list
and the detail; meanwhile larger devices, such as tablets, can display the
list and the detail simultaneously.

This app is based off the [starter code](https://github.com/google-developer-training/basic-android-kotlin-training-sports/tree/starter)
for the Sports app in Android Basics [Unit 3](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-3).

## Learning Outcomes
- Use `SlidingPaneLayout` to implement a list-detail pattern that adapts
  to different screen sizes.
- Implement custom back-navigation
