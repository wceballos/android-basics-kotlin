## Learning Outcomes
- An introduction to Android Architecture Components.
- Use `ViewModel` to preserve data across configuration changes.
- Use `LiveData` with Data Binding to update the UI when values change.
- Use *separation of concerns* design principle to separate the app into
  two responsibilities: a UI Controller that's in charge of displaying
  content and capturing user events; and a ViewModel that holds and
  prepares the data for the UI.
  - Make the app accessible with `Talkback`.
- Use `MaterialAlertDialog`.
