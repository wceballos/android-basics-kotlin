# Amphibians app
App \#2 in Unit 4: Connect to the Internet

## Introduction

This Amphibians app contains a list of amphibians and details about them. The
app demonstrates everything learned in Unit 4: connecting to the internet and
REST concepts with
[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and
[Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/) to connect to a RESTful service and
parse JSON data.

The app also leverages Kotlin Coroutines for network requests,
[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), and
[Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/)
with binding adapters.

This app is based off the [starter code](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-basics-kotlin-amphibians-app/tree/main)
for the Amphibians app in Android Basics [Unit 4](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-4).
The automated tests were provided by the starter code and not altered.
