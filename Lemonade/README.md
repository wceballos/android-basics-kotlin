## Introduction
A simple interactive app that allows the user to pick lemons from a tree to
make lemonade.

## Learning Outcomes
- Build an app independently using Unit 1 materials.
- Run tests to verify the app is built in accordance with the [project instructions](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-project-lemonade)
